## NEW QUOTES TO ADD (40+ additional)

### Investing
- "A great business at a fair price is superior to a fair business at a great price."
- "The desire to get rich fast is pretty dangerous."
- "If the value of a company doesn't just scream out at you, it's too close."
- "You don't have to have perfect wisdom to get very rich. Just a bit better than average over a long period of time."
- "When you locate a bargain, you must ask, 'Why me, God? Why am I the only one who could find this bargain?'"
- "Our job is to find a few intelligent things to do, not to keep up with every damn thing in the world."
- "There are huge advantages for an individual to get into a position where you make a few great investments and just sit back."
- "One of the inane things taught in modern university education is that a vast diversification is absolutely mandatory in investing in common stocks. That is an insane idea."
- "I think life is a whole series of opportunity costs. You got to marry the best person who is convenient to find who will have you. Investment is much the same sort of a process."
- "It's waiting that helps you as an investor, and a lot of people just can't stand to wait."
- "If something is too hard, we move on to something else. What could be simpler than that?"
- "Like Warren, I had a considerable passion to get rich, not because I wanted Ferraris — I wanted the independence. I desperately wanted it."

### Thinking & Wisdom
- "I believe in the discipline of mastering the best that other people have ever figured out. I don't believe in just sitting down and trying to dream it all up yourself. Nobody's that smart."
- "People are trying to be smart — all I am trying to do is not to be idiotic, but it's harder than most people think."
- "Just avoid things like racing trains to the crossing, doing cocaine, etc. Develop good mental habits."

- "It never ceases to amaze me to see how much territory can be grasped if one merely masters and consistently uses all the obvious and easily learned principles."
- "Rapid destruction of your ideas when the time is right is one of the most valuable qualities you can acquire. You must force yourself to consider arguments on the other side."
- "I did not succeed in life by intelligence. I succeeded because I have a long attention span."
- "Above all, live with change and adapt to it."
- "If you go through life making friends with the eminent dead who had the right ideas, I think it will work better for you in life."
- "There is no better teacher than history in determining the future. There are answers worth billions of dollars in a $30 history book."
- "Just as civilization can progress only when it invents the method of invention, you can progress only when you learn the method of learning."

### Character & Life
- "It's a good habit to trumpet your failures and be quiet about your successes."

- "I have a black belt in chutzpah. I was born with it."
- "The best armor of old age is a well-spent life preceding it."
- "If you're glued together right and honorable, you will succeed. Get in there and get rid of stupidities and avoid bad people. Try teaching that to your grandchildren. The best way is by example. Fix yourself."
- "It's a real pleasure to earn the trust of your customers slowly over time by doing what's right."
- "Life and its various passages can be hard, brutally hard. The three things I have found helpful in coping with its challenges are: Have low expectations. Have a sense of humor. Surround yourself with the love of friends and family."

### Psychology & Incentives
- "A lot of people with high IQs are terrible investors because they've got terrible temperaments."
- "I think that, every time you see the word EBITDA, you should substitute the words 'bullshit earnings.'"
- "Envy is a really stupid sin because it's the only one you could never possibly have any fun at. There's a lot of pain and no fun. Why would you want to get on that trolley?"
- "The constant curse of scale is that it leads to big, dumb bureaucracy — which, of course, reaches its highest and worst form in government where the incentives are really awful."

## MUNGER'S 25 COGNITIVE BIASES (New section for the site)

From "The Psychology of Human Misjudgment" — these are the complete 25 tendencies:

1. **Reward and Punishment Superresponse Tendency** — "Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome." We are driven by rewards and deterred by punishments far more than we realize.
2. **Liking/Loving Tendency** — We ignore faults in people and things we love. Affection distorts our judgment.
3. **Disliking/Hating Tendency** — We ignore virtues in people and things we dislike, and distort facts to justify our hatred.
4. **Doubt-Avoidance Tendency** — Uncertainty is uncomfortable, so we rush to make decisions to eliminate doubt, often with insufficient information.
5. **Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency** — We resist changing our habits, beliefs, and conclusions, even when presented with new evidence. The human mind is like the human egg — once a conclusion gets in, it shuts everything else out.
6. **Curiosity Tendency** — Our natural curiosity drives learning and discovery. Munger: "The curious are provided with much fun and wisdom once formal education has ended."
7. **Kantian Fairness Tendency** — We expect fairness and are deeply disturbed when we don't get it. Tolerating a little unfairness can lead to greater fairness overall.
8. **Envy/Jealousy Tendency** — Munger says: "It's not greed that drives the world, but envy." Surprisingly absent from most psychology textbooks.
9. **Reciprocation Tendency** — We feel compelled to return favors and slights alike. This can lead to poor decisions based on minor gestures.
10. **Influence-from-Mere-Association Tendency** — We are manipulated by associations — products linked to celebrities, bad news linked to messengers. Known as "Persian Messenger Syndrome."
11. **Simple, Pain-Avoiding Psychological Denial** — We deny reality when it's too painful to accept. "The reality is too painful to bear, so one distorts the facts until they become bearable."
12. **Excessive Self-Regard Tendency** — We overestimate our abilities. This is where overconfidence comes from.
13. **Over-Optimism Tendency** — We tend to be unrealistically optimistic, underestimating risks and challenges.
14. **Deprival-Superreaction Tendency** — Loss aversion. Losing something provokes a far stronger reaction than gaining something of equal value. "Losses are twice as powerful as gains."
15. **Social-Proof Tendency** — We look to others for cues on how to think and act, especially under uncertainty. "It is not only action by others that misleads but also their inaction."
16. **Contrast-Misreaction Tendency** — Our perceptions are skewed by comparisons rather than absolute values. A $100 price seems cheap after seeing a $1,000 option.
17. **Stress-Influence Tendency** — Excessive stress leads to extreme reactions and impaired decision-making. Some stress improves performance; heavy stress causes dysfunction.
18. **Availability-Misweighing Tendency** — We overweight information that is recent, vivid, or easy to recall. "Ask the Coca-Cola company if availability changes behavior."
19. **Use-It-or-Lose-It Tendency** — Skills atrophy without practice. A skill you don't use regularly will fade.
20. **Drug-Misinfluence Tendency** — Chemical dependency always causes moral breakdown and involves massive denial.
21. **Senescence-Misinfluence Tendency** — Aging causes cognitive decline, though continuous learning can slow it significantly.
22. **Authority-Misinfluence Tendency** — We follow authority figures too readily, even when they're wrong. Think Milgram's experiments.
23. **Twaddle Tendency** — People often produce meaningless talk that wastes time and confuses issues.
24. **Reason-Respecting Tendency** — People comply more readily when given a reason, even a nonsensical one. "Tell people why and they'll be far more likely to comply."
25. **Lollapalooza Tendency** — When multiple biases combine in the same direction, the result is extreme — far more powerful than any single bias. This explains cults, bubbles, and manias.

## NEW PAGE IDEA: "Munger's Checklist"

Munger used a formal checklist approach to decision-making. This could be its own page:

### The Two-Track Analysis:
1. **Track One:** What are the factors that really govern the interests involved, rationally considered?
2. **Track Two:** What are the subconscious influences where the brain is automatically doing things — which by and large are useful, but which often misfunction?

### Munger's Investing Checklist:
- What are the big risks?
- What's the moat — how durable is the competitive advantage?
- Who's managing the business? Are they trustworthy and competent?
- What's the price relative to intrinsic value?
- What's my margin of safety?
- Am I within my circle of competence?
- What could go wrong? (Inversion)
- Is this the best use of capital? (Opportunity cost)

### The "Iron Prescriptions":
- Don't have an opinion on a subject unless you can state the arguments against your position better than the people who support it
- Avoid intense ideology — it "cabbages up one's mind"
- Avoid self-serving bias
- Avoid self-pity
- Avoid envy and resentment
